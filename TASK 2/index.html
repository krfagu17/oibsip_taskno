                    top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best contemporary batsmen in the world. He plays
                    for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League, and has been the team's captain since
                    2013.</p>

        <div class="biography">
            <p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli,
                worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother,
                Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[8] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced
                his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[9] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early
                affinity for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill,
                and request his father to bowl to him.[10]

                In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WCDA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Kohli, who'd
                espoused his

                younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to
                meet Rajkumar Sharma, who initially perceived him to be just another enthusiastic and determined young
                boy. However, two weeks later, Sharma was impressed by Kohli's accuracy and power in throwing.[11] Upon
                the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional
                cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully
                cricket.[12] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the
                under-14 Delhi team, not due to a lack of merit but due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli received
                offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined
                the proposals, as he was determined that Kohli should earn his recognition based on his own merit and
                overcome the system of nepotism and deceit prevalent in the Delhi and District Cricket Association
